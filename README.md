# Stranded2
The Stranded II source code

!!!Still uploading!!!

Firstly, I uploaded this here, because of safety purposes.

Secondly, if anyone have some interest in it, please help with porting this to Linux. It needs Blitz 3D to compile, it is open source, it also needs to be ported AFAIK (it has a Github repo, but I forked it, so you can find it here too).

===============================================================
WTH is that?!
===============================================================

This is the full source code of Stranded II 1.0.0.1*
for the programming language Blitz 3D (www.blitzbasic.com)

*) with some minor changes after the release of 1.0.0.1

Also see:

===============================================================
How to use
===============================================================

NOTE:
YOU NEED BLITZ3D TO USE THIS (VERSION 1.98 OR HIGHER)!
YOU CAN'T RUN IT WITH THE DEMO VERSION!

- put "source/StrandedII.bb" in your Stranded II dir
- put "source/includes"-dir in your Stranded II dir
- put "userlibs/user32.decls" in the userlibs dir of Blitz 3D
- add the text "-inbb" to the Blitz 3D Program Command Line
- recommended: also add "-win" to the Command Line
- Open and compile "StrandedII.bb"!
