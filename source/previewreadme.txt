"previewimagecapturer.bb" is a tiny tool I used to make icon images for Stranded II.
Put this code in your Stranded II folder and compile/run it.

The source file has to be entered in the code.

Controls:
[press + move left mouse button]: move model
[press + move right mouse button]: rotate model
[mouse wheel]: zoom in/out
[1]: set top left corner of image capture area (@mousepointer)
[2]: set bottom right corner of image capture area (@mousepointer)
[ENTER]: save image in caputre area as 40x40 pixel bmp!

!!! Warning: It can overwrite icons without asking as soon as you press enter !!!
